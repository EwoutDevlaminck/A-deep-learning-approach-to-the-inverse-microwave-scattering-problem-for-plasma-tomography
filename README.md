# 10_final_notebooks
The final, heavily trimmed notebooks containing most of the machinery and some results from my master thesis work

Notebook 01 : The basic notebook containing the FDTD code and the setup needed to simulate the different cases studied.

Notebook 02 : A trimmed down version, containing only the JET-like profile setup, allowing the user to create a dataset of simulations for neural network training

Notebook 03 : The notebook containing all the neural network research for the plasma torch case

--Future--

Notebook 04 : Similar to 03, but for the JET-like case

Notebook 05 : Another notebook for neural network creation, but this time not to predict the tomographic structure, but to predict the prescense of perturbation in the form of ELM proxies.

-- Extra--

Notebook 99 : Not crucial, but can be used to create snapshots of the simulation, allowing the user to make videos, which, you have to admit, is quite nice.
